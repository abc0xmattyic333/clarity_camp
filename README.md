👋🏻 Hello, and welcome❗️ My name is abc0xmattyic333 🙋🏼‍♂️.

This repository showcases my journey 🧭 into Clarity. 

Here are a few reasons why I decided to learn Clarity:

- 1. The language itself is pretty new.
- 2. Clarity is a language for writing smart contracts that run on the stacks blockchain.
- 3. Clarity is interpreted, not compiled. Clarity code is interpreted and committed to the chain exactly as written ✍🏻.
- 4. Clarity is decidable, a decidable language has the property that from the code itself, you can know with certainty what the program will do.
- 5. Clarity does not permit reentrancy.
- 6. Clarity guards against overflow and underflows.
- 7. Support for custom tokens 🪙 built-in
- 8. Access to the base chain: ₿itcoin

Clarity smart contracts can read the state of the ₿itcoin base chain. It means you can use ₿itcoin transactions as a trigger in your smart contracts❗️ Clarity also features a number of built-in functions to verify secp256k1 signatures and recover keys 🔑.
