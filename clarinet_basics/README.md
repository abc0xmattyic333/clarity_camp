# Clarinet Basics

Hello, welcome back. I created this scaffold project using Clarinet.

I used the following command in my terminal:

```
clarinet new first-project
```

I then created a new counter contract by using the following command:

```
clarinet contract new counter
```

We can check âœ… the contract using the following command:

```
clarinet check
```
