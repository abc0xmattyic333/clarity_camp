# Clarity Basics

- LISP-like syntax

- Can be conceptualized by thinking of lists inside lists or nested lists

- Expressions use Pre Polish notation [S Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression)

- Follow a basic pattern: opening parenthesis, followed by a function name, optionally followed by a number of input parameters, and a closing parenthesis

- Comments can be inline and are prefixed by a double semicolon (;;)
