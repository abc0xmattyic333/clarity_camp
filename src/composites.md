# Composites

These are more complex types that contain a number of other types.
Composites make it a lot easier to create larger smart contracts.

# Optionals

The type system in Clarity does not allow for empty values. It means that a boolean is always either **true** or **false**, and an integer always contains a number. But sometimes you want to be able to express a variable that could have some value, or nothing. For this you use the **optional** type. This type wraps a different type and can either be **none** or a value of that type. The optional type is very powerful and the tooling will perform checks to make sure they are handled properly in the code. Let us look at a few examples.

Wrapping a **uint**:

```
(some u5)
;; (some u5)
```

An ASCII string:

```
(some "An optional containing a string.")
```

Or even a principal:

```
(some 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE)
```

Nothing is represented by the keyword none:

```
none
```

Functions that might or might not return a value tend to return an **optional type**. As we saw in the previous section, both element-at and index-of returned a (some ...). It is because for some inputs, no matching value can be found. We can take the same list but this time try to retrieve an element at an index larger than the total size of the list. We see that it results in a **none** value.

In order to access the value contained within an optional, you have to **unwrap** it.

```
(unwrap-panic (some u10))
;; u10
```

Trying to unwrap a **none** will result in an error because there is nothing to unwrap. The ‚Äùpanic‚Äù in unwrap-panic should give that away.

```
(unwrap-panic none)
;; error
```

We will dive ü§ø into error handling and defining custom functions.

# Tuples

Tuples are records üßæ that hold multiple values in named fields. Each field has its own type, making it very useful to pass along structured data in one go. Tuples have their own **special formatting** and use curly braces.

```
{
	id: u5, ;; a uint
	username: "ClarityIsAwesome", ;; an ASCI string
	address: 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE ;; and a principal
}
```

The members inside tuples are unordered. You retrieve them by name and cannot iterate over them. A specific member can be read using the get function.

```
(get username { id: 5, username: "ClarityIsAwesome" } )
;; ClarityIsAwesome
```

Tuples, like other values, are **immutable once defined**. It means that they cannot be changed. You can, however, merge two tuples together to form a new tuple. Merging is done from left to right and will overwrite values with the same key üîë.

```
(merge
	{id: 5, score: 10, username: "ClarityIsAwesome"}
	{score: 20, winner: true}
)
```

The above expression will result in a tuple with both keys üîë merged and the score set to **20**.

Since the merge function returns an entirely new tuple, member types can in fact be overwritten by a later tuple in the sequence.

### Responses

A response is a composite type that **wraps another type** just like an **optional**. What is different, however, is that a response type includes an indication of whether a specific action was successful or a failure. Responses have special effects when returned by public functions.

Developers usually come up with their own rules to indicate error status. You could for example use unsigned integers to represent a specific error code.

```
(err u5) ;; something went wrong
```

There are **no explicit rules** on which types you should wrap for your responses.

Standards are currently being proposed and we be introduced to **Stacks Improvements Proposals (SIPs)**.

Responses can be **unwrapped** in the same way as **optional types**:

```
(unwrap-panic (ok true))
;; true
```

**Private functions and read-only functions may also return a response type.**
