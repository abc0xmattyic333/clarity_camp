# Stacks 🥞 Blockchain and Proof of Transfer (PoX)

**Understanding the Stacks blockchain and it’s consensus mechanism called Proof of Transfer (PoX).**

- 1. Sound Money 💰: Built in 2️⃣0️⃣0️⃣9️⃣, ₿itcoin is the first and most popular decentralized digital currency 🪙. It has purchasing power, independent of any sort of governance, and can be characterized as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. It has become a recognized asset outside of the cryptocurrency world and acknowledged by governments, large corporations, and legacy banking 🏦 institutions as well.

- 2. Secure and Decentralized: ₿itcoin fulfills 2 out of 3 ideal aspects of blockchain-based money system that is Security and Decentralization. ₿itcoin is one of the most secure cryptocurrencies. Influencing or attacking the ₿itcoin network is impractical and a challenging aspect for any potential hackers because it has achieved computation to a level that it cannot be thrown away through massive computation alone. Now the only way if you think to take control of the ₿itcoin network is either to try every possible value of private key and see if it generates a corresponding public key or carry out such an attack would require 51% control over the computing resources - so a well coordinated acquisition and coordination of resources beyond even the most powerful countries. ₿itcoin blockchain is truly decentralized and immutable, which means that neither a single person or group has control over data and the data entered is irreversible.

- 3. Highly Underutilized: The 3rd aspect that ₿itcoin lacks is the Scalability and till date ₿itcoin is dramatically underutilized. It really is a functionally limited blockchain. Now, we cannot ignore the fact that BTC has held the highest market capitalization of any cryptocurrency for the past decade. Therefore there is an urgency to unlock the potential of ₿itcoin by bringing Smart Contracts to activate the utilization of the hundreds of billions in capital in ₿itcoin and by making interactive cryptocurrency applications available to ₿itcoin holders.

# Proof of Transfer - How Does it work❓🤔

#### In PoX:

₿itcoin miners 🪏 spend energy ⚡️ in order to earn BTC, Stacks miners 🪏 spend ₿itcoin in order to earn STX.

PoX also has a sustainability benefit, as electricity ⚡️ already spent to secure ₿itcoin is reused by Stacks, allowing builders 👷🏼‍♂️ to create more value from energy ⚡️ already spent.

On the other side, Stackers lock their STX and as an incentive they can earn the BTC spent by the miner 🪏 to keep the Stacks network 🛜 honest, and secure.
